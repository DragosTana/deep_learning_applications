This repository contains the implementations of all the laboratory exercises completed during the Deep Learning Application course (Spring 2024). My primary focus is on Laboratories 1, 2, and 4. Although I played abit with DQL in Laboratory 3, there is nothing significant to mention.

## Laboratory 1 - CNNs

I used this opportunity to familiarize myself with PyTorch Lightning. The focus was on creating a classification pipeline, understanding the effect of skip connections on network performance, and implementing an interactive version of GradCAM.

## Laboratory 2 - NLP

In this laboratory, I implemented my own Trainer class and tried to minimize the use of Huggingface tools. Besides experimenting with GPT-2, I primarily focused on classification tasks and multiple-choice question answering on different datasets.

## Laboratory 4 - Adversarial Examples and OOD detection

My primary focus here was on creating an OOD detection pipeline by comparing a strong baseline with the ODIN detector. Additionally, I implemented the FGSM algorithm in both targeted and untargeted forms and evaluated its performance.

Please reference the README inside every lab repository for more details.
